The various agencies within the administration must then share the necessary information with each other. The National Data Catalog is the first step in order to reach this goal. <br><br>The cooperative body SKATE (Managing and coordinating services in electronic administration) has described the ambition for information management as a process of three levels. The National Data Catalog being the first level, providing a common overview of data and a shared understanding of information in the shape of terms. The next level focuses on the availability of information in a common API Catalogue, this work is initiated. In the third level, everything should be set for reuse of data being the main rule and for the use of the principle of reporting information once only.<br><br>The Government's circular on digitalisation emphasizes that all public agencies must have an overview of which data they process, what the data mean, what they can be used for, which processes they are included in and who are allowed to use the data (information management).<br><br>In cooperation with public agencies, The Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (Difi) will establish a common framework for information management in public agencies. The National Data Catalog is a project to achieve common goals. Each agency must create its own overviews and descriptions, 'Order in house'. Difi is facilitating so that a common set of methods, standards and guidances is created, tested and used by agencies who is creating 'Order in house'. This includes organising and roles to establish systematic administration and good exploitation of data. An open network will inspire, inform and involve.<br><br> The framework  will help the political goals of 'once only' and increased use of public data.
